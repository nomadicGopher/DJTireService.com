                            <blockquote><p>“Dave and his son came and serviced my Civic and my girlfriends Mazda this week. For the Mazda I needed the snow tires taken off, and new tires and summer wheels put on. My Civic had a vibration and, due to work and moving, I haven't had time to take it in and have it balanced. Dave and his son came to my home and took care of both of our vehicles in my driveway while I was inside working on plumbing in my new house. The service was fast, very convenient and done very well. We will definitely be using them again in the future for all our tire issues.”</p></blockquote>
